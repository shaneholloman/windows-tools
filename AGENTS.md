# Agent guidance - mikerosoft.app

Instructions for AI agents (Cursor, etc.) working in this repo.

## Repo purpose

A bunch of personalised tools for Windows users. Each tool lives in its own
subfolder. `install.ps1` wires everything into `C:\dev\tools` (which is on
PATH) via thin stub `.bat` files or `.lnk` shortcuts.

---

## Key rules

- **Never put source files directly in `C:\dev\tools`.** All logic belongs in
  this repo under the appropriate tool subfolder. `C:\dev\tools` only ever
  gets auto-generated stubs from `install.ps1`.
- **Large binaries stay in `C:\dev\tools`**, not here. Never commit `.exe` or
  `.dll` files. They are gitignored.
- **Test before committing.** Run the actual script/tool to verify it works.
  For `.ps1` scripts, run them directly with PowerShell. For `.vbs` launchers,
  run via `wscript.exe`. Check exit codes.
- **No console windows for GUI/taskbar tools.** Use the `.vbs` launcher pattern
  (see `tools\scale-monitor\scale-monitor.vbs`) which calls `wscript.exe` with
  window style 0. Never launch PowerShell from a taskbar shortcut without a
  `.vbs` wrapper — it causes a CMD window to flash.
- **ASCII encoding for `.bat` files.** Always write bat files with
  `-Encoding ASCII` in PowerShell, or avoid non-ASCII characters entirely.
  Em dashes and curly quotes in string literals will cause parse errors.
- **Re-run `install.ps1` after adding a new tool.** Editing an existing tool
  never requires reinstall — stubs point at the live repo files.

---

## deps.ps1 convention

Each tool can have an optional `<name>\deps.ps1` that installs or checks its
dependencies. Rules:

- **Idempotent** — check before installing; safe to run multiple times.
- **Self-contained** — must work when run directly (`.\tools\transcribe\deps.ps1`).
- **Clear output** — use `Write-Host` with colour so the user sees what happened.
- For large manual-download binaries (e.g. `ffmpeg.exe`), just check and print
  a helpful message; don't try to auto-download.
- For Python packages use `pip install`; check `python -c "import pkg"` first.
- For system tools (e.g. Docker) use `Get-Command` to detect and warn if absent.

`install.ps1` auto-discovers every `*/deps.ps1` under the repo root and runs
them in alphabetical order. Pass `-SkipDeps` to skip this step.

---

## Adding a CLI tool

1. `mkdir <name>` in the repo root
2. Write `<name>\<name>.bat` (or `.ps1`) with the full logic
3. If the tool needs `ffmpeg.exe`, `faster-whisper-xxl.exe`, or other large
 binaries that live in `C:\dev\tools`, accept `EXEDIR` as an env var
 and fall back: `if not defined EXEDIR set "EXEDIR=%~dp0"`
4. If the tool has external dependencies, write `<name>\deps.ps1`
5. Add a `Write-BatStub` call in `install.ps1`
6. Run `install.ps1`
7. Smoke-test: open a new terminal and call the command by name
8. Update `README.md` to add the tool to the list with its icon.
9. Add a `tools/<name>/icons/<name>.png` icon (e.g. from famfamfam-silk).
10. Update `website/src/index.js` to add the tool to the site.
11. Commit

## Adding a taskbar / GUI tool

1. `mkdir <name>` in the repo root
2. Write `<name>\<name>.ps1` with WinForms or notification logic
3. Copy `tools\scale-monitor\scale-monitor.vbs` as `tools\<name>\<name>.vbs` and update
 the filename reference inside it
4. If the tool has external dependencies, write `<name>\deps.ps1`
5. Add a shortcut block in `install.ps1` (see the `scale-monitor` section)
6. Run `install.ps1`
7. Test via `wscript.exe "C:\dev\me\mikerosoft.app\tools\<name>\<name>.vbs"`
8. Right-click the generated `.lnk` in `C:\dev\tools` → Pin to taskbar
9. Update `README.md` to add the tool to the list with its icon.
10. Add a `tools/<name>/icons/<name>.png` icon (e.g. from famfamfam-silk).
11. Update `website/src/index.js` to add the tool to the site.
12. Commit

---

## Editing an existing tool

1. Edit the file in this repo directly (e.g. `tools\scale-monitor\scale-monitor.ps1`)
2. Test it: run via `wscript.exe` (GUI) or directly with PowerShell (CLI)
3. Commit — no reinstall needed

## task-stats specifics

Replacement for TrafficMonitor / XMeters. Displays NET↑/↓, CPU, GPU, MEM as
sparkline graphs on the right side of the Windows taskbar, positioned just to
the LEFT of the system clock (detected via `TrayNotifyWnd`).

### Icons
Right-click menu icons come from the **famfamfam silk icon set** (Mark James, CC BY 2.5).
Source: https://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/
The PNGs live in `task-stats\icons\` and are embedded into the DLL as manifest resources via
`<EmbeddedResource Include="icons\*.png" />` in `task-stats.csproj`.

### Architecture
- **No .NET SDK required.** Built by `MSBuild.exe` from .NET Framework 4
  (`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe`).
- Project file: `task-stats\task-stats.csproj` (targets .NET Framework 4, embeds `icons\*.png` as manifest resources).
- Compiled DLL is cached at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\task-stats\task-stats.dll`.
- `task-stats.ps1` is a thin launcher - it loads the DLL and calls `[TaskMon.App]::Run()`.
  No compilation at runtime, so startup is instant and no OOM risk in Cursor.

### Dev workflow
```
cd task-stats
.\build-and-run.bat    # kill old instance + compile + launch
```
After code changes to any `.cs` file, just re-run `build-and-run.bat`.

### Key implementation details
- `OverlayForm` is a frameless `WS_POPUP` + `HWND_TOPMOST` WinForms Form.
- `TransparencyKey = BackColor` makes the dark background see-through so the
  taskbar shows through. Only sparklines and text are visible.
- Position: `TrayLeftEdge()` finds `Shell_TrayWnd → TrayNotifyWnd` via
  `FindWindowEx` + `GetWindowRect` to know where the clock starts.
- `StartPosition = Manual` is critical - without it, `Show()` overrides the
  position set in the constructor.
- Z-order: a 100 ms timer re-asserts `HWND_TOPMOST` + a `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED`
  handler does it immediately on any z-order change.
- GPU: NVML P/Invoke (`nvml.dll`) - no `nvidia-smi` subprocess.
- CPU: `PerformanceCounter("Processor", "% Processor Time")` - aggregate +
  per-core for the XMeters-style grid mode.
- Settings: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\task-stats\settings.json` (richly commented JSON).
  Right-click overlay → Settings to change via UI.

### Known limitations
- In exclusive-fullscreen mode (rare - most modern games use borderless) the
  overlay may briefly disappear and return within ~100 ms.
- A 1-2 frame flicker when switching between maximized apps. This is caused
  by the overlay being a separate compositor surface from the taskbar. See
  [`task-stats/FLICKER-RESEARCH.md`](task-stats/FLICKER-RESEARCH.md) for detailed
  investigation notes and the approaches tried (DWM attributes,
  WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING interception, SetParent embedding). The proper fix
  requires rewriting rendering from `UpdateLayeredWindow` to `WM_PAINT` +
  `WS_CHILD` embedding into `Shell_TrayWnd`.

### Important paths for task-stats

## voice-type specifics

Push-to-talk voice transcription tool. Hold Right Ctrl to record, release to transcribe and inject text into the active window.

### Dev workflow

After any code change to `tools\voice-type\voice-type.py`, restart with:

```
cd tools\voice-type
restart.bat
```

`restart.bat` kills all existing instances then relaunches via `voice-type.vbs`.
Always use this - never launch `voice-type.py` directly with `Start-Process` or
`python`, as that bypasses the kill step and leaves multiple instances running.

After restarting, confirm a clean startup:
```powershell
Get-Content voice-type\voice-type.log | Select-Object -Last 5
```

To verify exactly one instance is running:
```powershell
cmd /c "tasklist /FO CSV" | ConvertFrom-Csv | Where-Object { $_."Image Name" -like "*python*" }
```

**Rules:**
- Always kill all instances before launching a new one. Never leave multiple instances running.
- Always launch via `restart.bat` or `voice-type.vbs` - never directly with `Start-Process python ...`.
- After launching, tail the log to confirm a clean startup.

## scale-monitor specifics

- Monitor: HG584T05, "Display 4", AMD Radeon Graphics
- Registry key: `HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\PerMonitorSettings\RTK8405_0C_07E9_97^C9A428C8B2686559443005CCA2CE3E2E`
- `DpiValue = 4` → 200% scaling (normal use)
- `DpiValue = 7` → 300% scaling (filming)
- The script modifies the registry then broadcasts `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` +
  calls `ChangeDisplaySettingsEx("\\.\DISPLAY4", CDS_RESET)` to apply live

## PowerShell tips for this repo

```powershell
# Run a ps1 directly for testing
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\scale-monitor\scale-monitor.ps1

# Run a tool via its vbs launcher (same as taskbar click)
wscript.exe ".\tools\scale-monitor\scale-monitor.vbs"

# Re-run install after adding a tool
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1

# Check what's in c:\dev\tools (should only be stubs + exes)
Get-ChildItem C:\dev\tools\*.bat | Select-Object Name, Length
```
