# ![](icons/video-titles.png) video-titles

Interactive CLI chat tool for brainstorming YouTube video titles. Uses the Compelling Title Matrix framework as a system prompt and chats with Gemini via OpenRouter. Auto-detects (or generates) a transcript, then drops you into a back-and-forth chat session. Every exchange is logged to a `.jsonl` file next to the video.

## Usage

**From File Explorer:**
Right-click any video file, choose **Mike's Tools > Video Titles**.
(On Windows 11, click "Show more options" first.)

**From the terminal:**

```
video-titles <video_file>
```

On launch the tool:

1. Looks for a `<videoname>.srt` alongside the video and loads it as context.
2. If no SRT exists, offers to run the `transcribe` tool to generate one.
3. Drops into an interactive chat. Type a message and press Enter to send.
4. Type `quit` to exit.

Each exchange is appended as plain text to `<videoname>-titles.txt` in the same folder as the video.
