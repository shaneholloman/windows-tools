# video-to-markdown

Convert a YouTube URL into a ready-to-paste markdown image link and copy it to your clipboard in seconds.

Uses the [video-to-markdown.com](https://video-to-markdown.com) public API. Videos are processed and cached server-side, so repeated calls for the same URL are instant.

---

## What it produces

Given a YouTube URL, the tool calls the API and puts something like this on your clipboard:

```markdown
[![Never Gonna Give You Up](https://thumbs.video-to-markdown.com/abc123.jpg)](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
```

Paste it into any Markdown file and you get a clickable thumbnail that links back to the video.

---

## Usage

### Right-click menu (any file or folder)

Right-click **anything** in Explorer - any file type, any folder - open **Mike's Tools** and choose **Video to Markdown**. A terminal window opens:

1. Paste the YouTube URL (pre-filled automatically if your clipboard already has one)
2. Press **Enter**
3. On success: "Copied to clipboard!" appears with the video title

### Right-click a `.url` Internet Shortcut (silent-ish mode)

Right-click a Windows Internet Shortcut (`.url` file) and choose **Video to Markdown**. The tool reads the URL from the file and converts it - no typing required.

### Command line

```
video-to-markdown                       # prompt for URL (clipboard pre-filled if YouTube URL is there)
video-to-markdown https://youtu.be/...  # convert directly
video-to-markdown "My Video.url"        # read URL from a Windows Internet Shortcut
```

---

## Workflow tip

Copy the YouTube URL from your browser before right-clicking - the prompt is pre-filled so you just hit Enter.
