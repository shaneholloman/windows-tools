# mikes-windows-tools

Personal Windows productivity scripts and CLI tools.

## Setup (run once after cloning)

```powershell
cd C:\dev\mikes-windows-tools
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

This writes thin stub `.bat` files into `C:\dev\tools` (which is on PATH).  
The stubs simply forward to the real source files in this repo.

**After that, updating any tool is just:**

```powershell
git pull
```

No reinstall needed — stubs point permanently into the repo.  
Re-run `install.ps1` only when a **new tool** is added.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `transcribe <video>` | Extracts audio and transcribes via faster-whisper (CUDA/CPU) |
| `removebg <image>` | Removes image background using rembg/birefnet |
| `backup-phone` | Backs up Android phone over ADB |
| `all-hands` | Launches OpenHands AI coding agent via Docker |
| Scale Monitor 4 *(taskbar)* | Toggles Monitor 4 between 200% (normal) and 300% (filming) |

## Adding a new tool

1. Create a subfolder: `mkdir my-tool`
2. Put all source files (`.ps1`, `.vbs`, `.bat`) in it
3. Add a stub entry to `install.ps1`
4. Run `install.ps1` once to wire it up
5. Commit

## Directory layout

```
mikes-windows-tools/
├── install.ps1          ← run once to wire everything up
├── transcribe/
│   └── transcribe.bat
├── removebg/
│   └── removebg.bat
├── all-hands/

    └── scale-monitor4.bat
```

## Notes

- Large binaries (`ffmpeg.exe`, `faster-whisper-xxl.exe`, etc.) live in `C:\dev\tools` and are **not** tracked here.
- The `transcribe` stub passes `EXEDIR=C:\dev\tools` so the bat finds those binaries.
- The `Scale Monitor 4.lnk` taskbar shortcut is regenerated by `install.ps1` and lives in `C:\dev\tools`.
